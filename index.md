# Introduction

Okay I'm going to be honest with you: I still have to figure out how to organize this web-site.

So I'm placing some random stuff that came to my mind in the last few hours.
I'll briefly explain what I like to do, but please [have a look at my CV](cv_StagiRoberto.pdf) for a more thoughtful overview of my past experience.

# Who am I?
**I like to create things**. I like to innovate.

I enjoy coding, by writing elegant and well-tested software.
I also like photography, but I'm probably better as a programmer (or, at least, I've been told so).

I'm perfectly aware of what is the goal of what I do: **create value** for someone.
Yeah, I know, it's kind of a *cliché*, but having clear in mind where I'm delivering value helps me remaining focused, leading me to a state of mind in which I feel I make better decisions.

I've often struggled to unsterdand what is this so-called "business value" we, as developers, are delivering at the end of the day (does good testing coverage delivery any value? Or maybe fixing security issues does? The answer is not always so straight forward).
I still haven't come to a conclusion yet, but I'm getting better and better at making all the stakeholders happy. I'll let you know if I solve the puzzle :)

I value collaboration among everything else. I think the most amazing things are made by collaborating with someone.
For that reason, I always try to be the best version of a team member I can think of.

# What do I get my hands on?
Well, I easily like new stuff, so I've tried many things.
Above all, though, I've worked with **node.js** and **React**, usually relying on **MongoDB** and **Kubernetes**.

I like to define myself a generalist, since I've had top tier professional experience in almost every part of the cloud technology stack: Infrastructure, DevOps, Backend and Frontend. Someone might call me a **Full Stack Engineer**, but I've heard thet it's just a myth (well, is it?).

# What do I do for a living?
I'm currently a **Software Engineer** @ [Bending Spoons](https://bendingspoons.com/). You might have heard of it. If you still haven't, I'm sure you will more and more.
It's most probably the most innovative software company in Italy, which makes it a great workplace to be. I'm so proud of being here.

At the moment I'm working on [Evernote](https://www.evernote.com), mainly on the Backend, but I'm shoveling stuff on the frontend as well. Previously, I've worked on [Remini Web](https://app.remini.ai/), mainly on the Frontend.

Before joining Bending Spoons, I was **Technical Leader** @ [Mia-Platform](https://mia-platform.eu), an innovative and dynamic software company based in Milan, and **CTO** @ [SavingBud](https://www.savingbud.com), a Startup Company that moved its first steps in the Fintech and Insurtech world. Great experiences I had. They made me grow exponentially both personally and professionally.
