## Introduction

Okay I'm going to be honest with you: I still have to figure out how to organize this web-site.

So I'm placing some random stuff that came to my mind in the last few hours.
I'll briefly explain what I like to do, but please [have a look at my CV][cv_StagiRoberto.pdf] for a more detailed (and serious) overview of my past experience.

## Who am I?
**I like to create things**.  The more innovative the better.

I enjoy coding, by writing elegant and well-tested software.
I also like photography, but I'm probably better as a programmer (or, at least, I've been told so).

I'm perfectly aware of what is the goal of what I do: **generate value** for someone.
Yeah, I know, it's kind of a *cliche*, but having clear in mind what is the added value I'm creating, helps me to remain focused and to make better decisions.

I value collaboration among everything else. I think the most amazing things are made by collaborating with someone.
That means I always try to be a good team member, by improving my teamworking skills (I'm having the role of the Scrum Master for the team I'm in at work).

## What do I get my hands on?
Well, I easily like new stuff, so I've tried many things.
Above all, though, I've worked with **node.js** and **React**, usually relying on **MongoDB** and **Kubernetes**.
I worked extensively with **Go**, and with heavy data streams using **Kafka**.

I've also worked with *Java* and  *Flutter*, and I have professional experience in setting up monitoring systems with Prometheus and Grafana.

I also enjoyed working with some serverless solutions, like *Google Cloud Run* and the *Firebase Cloud Functions*.

## What do I do for a living?
I'm currently employed as a Full Stack Engineer @Â [Mia-Platform](https://mia-platform.eu), an innovative and dynamic software company based in Milan.

I work on the Mia-Platform main product: a DevOps console to aid in the cloud services development process.
I also work with customers, helping them to design and implement cloud-native solutions for their needs, as it would be done in a consulting company, by using our DevOps Console.
The latter is actually the main part of my daily work.

Besides that, I'm also involved in a cool startup in the insurance field: [SavingBud](https://www.savingbud.com).
The developers team is made of 3 amazing people (me included, of course).
As in many startups, we all tend to work on all the parts of the IT system we developed.
Due to my background knowledge, I happen to be the one who pushes the most on the DevOps practices.
