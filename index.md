# Roberto Stagi

## TL; DR;

What follows is not that seriously written, so if you're interested in my past experience please [look at my CV here](cv_StagiRoberto.pdf).

If you'd like to get in touch, mail me at the following address: [me@rstagi.com](mailto:me@rstagi.com)

## Introduction

Okay I'm going to be honest with you: I still have to figure out how to organize this web-site.

So I'm placing some random stuff that came to my mind in the last few hours.
I'll briefly explain what I like to do, but please [have a look at my CV](cv_StagiRoberto.pdf) for a more detailed (and serious) overview of my past experience.

## Who am I?
**I like to create things**.  The more innovative the better.

I enjoy coding, by writing elegant and well-tested software.
I also like photography, but I'm probably better as a programmer (or, at least, I've been told so).

I'm perfectly aware of what is the goal of what I do: **create value** for someone.
Yeah, I know, it's kind of a *cliche*, but having clear in mind what is the added value I'm delivering, helps me to remain focused and to make better decisions.
I've often struggled to unsterdand what is this so-called "business value" we, as developers, are delivering at the end of each sprint (does good testing coverage delivery any value? Fixing security holes does so? Well, in such cases of course yes, but the answers are not always so easy).
I still haven't come to a conclusion yet, but I'm getting better at making my customers happy. I'll let you know if I solve the puzzle :)

I value collaboration among everything else. I think the most amazing things are made by collaborating with someone.
That means I always try to be a good team member, by improving my teamworking skills (I'm having the role of the Scrum Master for the team I'm in at work).

## What do I get my hands on?
Well, I easily like new stuff, so I've tried many things.
Above all, though, I've worked with **node.js** and **React**, usually relying on **MongoDB** and **Kubernetes**.
I worked extensively with **Go**, and with heavy data streams using **Kafka**.

I've also worked with *Java* and  *Flutter*, and I have professional experience in setting up monitoring systems with Prometheus and Grafana.

I also enjoyed working with some serverless solutions, like *Google Cloud Run* and the *Firebase Cloud Functions*.

## What do I do for a living?
I'm currently employed as a Full Stack Engineer @Â [Mia-Platform](https://mia-platform.eu), an innovative and dynamic software company based in Milan.

I work on the Mia-Platform main product: a DevOps console to aid in the cloud services development process.
I also work with customers, helping them to design and implement cloud-native solutions for their needs, as it would be done in a consulting company, by using our DevOps Console.
The latter is actually the main part of my daily work.

Besides that, I'm the CTO of a cool italian startup: [SavingBud](https://www.savingbud.com). SavingBud is a FinTech Startup Company focused on easing the Complementary Pension Funds choise and subscription process. The developers team is made of 3 amazing people (me included, of course).
