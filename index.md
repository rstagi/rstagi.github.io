# Roberto Stagi

Okay I'm going to be honest with you: I still have to figure out how to organize this web-site.

So I'm placing some random stuff that came to my mind in the last few hours.
Among those, I'll briefly explain what I like to do, but please <a href="cv_StagiRoberto.pdf" download>download my CV</a> for a more serious overview of my past experience.

## Who am I?
**I like to create things**.  The more innovative the better.

I enjoy coding, I try to write elegant and well-tested software.
I also like photography, but I'm probably better at coding (or, at least, I've been told so).

I'm perfectly aware of what is my work's objective: **generate value** for someone.
Yeah I know, it's kind of a *cliche*, but I find that having clear in mind what is the added value I'm creating, helps me to remain focus and to make better decisions.

I value among everything else the collaboration. The most amazing things are made by collaborating in teams.
That means I always try to be a good team member, and I developed my teamworking skills.

## What do I have worked with?
Well, I easily like new stuff, so I've tried many things.
Above all, though, I've worked with **node.js** and **React**, usually relying on **MongoDB** and **Kubernetes**.
I worked extensively with **Go**, and with heavy data streams using **Kafka**.

I've also worked with *Java* and  *Flutter*, and I have professional experience in setting up monitoring systems with Prometheus and Grafana.

I also enjoyed working with some serverless solutions, like *Google Cloud Run*.

## What do I do for a living?
I'm currently employed as a Full Stack Engineer @Â [Mia-Platform](https://mia-platform.eu).

I work on the Mia-Platform main product (a DevOps console to help developing services in-cloud), but I also work with customers, helping them to design cloud-native solutions for their problems.

Besides that, I'm also involved in a cool startup in the previdencial field: [SavingBud](https://www.savingbud.com).
The developers team is made of 4 amazing people (me included).
As it happens in many startups, we all tend to work on all the parts of the IT system we developed.
However, due to my background knowledge, I happen to be the one who pushes the most on the DevOps practices.
